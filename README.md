# Blackjack Game

Blackjack is a Java application that simulates the classic card game.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the application.**
2. **Welcome Message:** The game starts with a welcome message.
3. **Initial Deal:** The dealer shuffles the deck and deals two cards to both the player and the dealer.
4. **Player's Turn:** The player can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
5. **Dealer's Turn:** The dealer will reveal their hidden card and hit until their hand value is 17 or higher.
6. **Determine Winner:** The winner is determined based on the hand values, following the rules of Blackjack.
7. **Next Round:** The player is prompted to play another round or quit the game.

## Concepts Practiced

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Utilization of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model the game components.
* **Collection Framework:** Use of `ArrayList` to manage cards in hands and the deck.
* **Control Flow:** Implementing game loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.
* **Exception Handling:** Basic exception handling for user inputs and game operations.
* **Java Enum Types:** Use of enums for card suits and ranks to ensure type safety and cleaner code.
